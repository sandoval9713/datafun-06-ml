"""src/datafun/app.py - Project script.

Author: Denise Case
Date: 2026-09

HOW TO RUN THIS FILE:

From the VS Code menu (with only this project open in VS Code),
click "Terminal" / New Terminal to
open an integrated Terminal in the root project folder.
Paste the following command and press ENTER or RETURN
to run this file as a script:

uv run python -m datafun.app

DOMAIN:

A dataset of penguins.
See docs/data-card.md for more information about the dataset.

EXPLORE:

Earlier analysis showed relationships among
numeric penguin measurements.

In this project, we use one numeric feature
to predict one numeric target
with a simple linear regression model.

A standard predictive modeling process is:

1. OBSERVE the data and prior findings.
2. DECLARE the target and feature.
3. PREPARE the modeling data.
4. SPLIT into training and test data.
5. BASELINE with a simple reference model.
6. TRAIN a LinearRegression model.
7. PREDICT on X_test.
8. EVALUATE baseline vs model on y_test.
9. VISUALIZE predictions and residuals.
10. ASSESS the results.

DESIGN:

Use this file to declare the data-specific choices
and the reasoning behind them,
then orchestrate the work.

Scikit-learn provides the machine learning tools.

The target, feature, split, baseline,
and model choices stay here because they are
analytical decisions specific to this project.

GRAIN: Final[str] = "one penguin"

# === DECLARE THE TARGET ===

# CUSTOM: Choose one NUMERIC target value to predict.
# This must match a numeric column name EXACTLY
# as it appears in the data file.

TARGET_COLUMN: Final[str] = "body_mass_g"

# === DECLARE THE FEATURE ===

# CUSTOM: Choose one NUMERIC feature
# that might help predict the target.
# This must match a numeric column name EXACTLY
# as it appears in the data file.

FEATURE_COLUMN: Final[str] = "bill_length_mm"

# === DOCUMENT WHY THE FEATURE MIGHT HELP ===

# CUSTOM: Document the reasoning behind the feature choice.
# Do not assume the feature will work well.
# The model and evaluation will provide evidence.

FEATURE_DECISION: Final[str] = r"""
I want to predict body mass.

I selected bill length as the feature.

A bigger penguin may have both a longer bill and more mass,
so bill length might contain useful information
for predicting body mass.

I do not know yet how well bill length will predict body mass.
The modeling process will provide evidence.
"""

# === DECLARE THE TRAIN / TEST SPLIT ===

# CUSTOM: Decide how much data should be held back for testing.
# The test data should NOT be used to train the model.

TEST_FRACTION: Final[float] = 0.20

# CUSTOM: Choose whether the random split should be reproducible.
# A fixed random seed makes the same split each time the script runs.

RANDOM_SEED: Final[int] = 42

# === DOCUMENT THE SPLIT DECISION ===

# CUSTOM: Document the reasoning behind BOTH choices.
# The fraction and random seed should not be unexplained numbers.

SPLIT_DECISION: Final[str] = r"""
I will use 80% of the modeling rows for training
and hold back 20% for testing.

I want most of the available data to be available
for learning the model,
while still keeping a separate set of observations
that the model did not see during training.

The test rows will be used later
to evaluate how the trained model performs
on unseen observations.

I will use a random seed of 42.

The specific value 42 is not analytically important.
I use a fixed seed so the random split is reproducible.
Running the project again will produce the same
training and test observations,
which makes results easier to reproduce and compare.
"""

# === DECLARE THE BASELINE ===

BASELINE_STRATEGY: Final[str] = "mean"

# === DOCUMENT THE BASELINE DECISION ===

BASELINE_DECISION: Final[str] = r"""
Before evaluating the LinearRegression model,
I need a simple baseline for comparison.

The baseline will ignore bill length
and predict the average body mass
from the training data for every test observation.

A useful predictive model should improve
on this simple reference prediction.
"""

# === DOCUMENT THE MODEL DECISION ===

MODEL_DECISION: Final[str] = r"""
I will use LinearRegression.

Linear regression fits a straight-line relationship
between the selected feature and target.

This gives a simple and interpretable model
that can be compared with the baseline.

Fitting a line does not prove that a straight line
is a good description of the relationship.

The evaluation metrics and residual plot
will help assess whether the model is useful.
